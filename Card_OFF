# 1. Remove anything related to the Nvidia proprietary driver.
  # For Ubuntu (and derivatives):
    sudo apt autoremove --purge *nvidia*
  # For Arch Linux (and derivatives):
    sudo pacman -Rns *nvidia*
  
# 2. Reboot.

# 3. Find and write down the adresses referring to the PCI connections.
  # There will likely be one for the video card and one for the video card's audio chipset. Register both.
    lspci | grep NVIDIA
      # For example:
        01:00.0 corresponds to the video card
        01:00.1 corresponde to the video card's audio interface
      
# 4. Install ACPI Call and headers:
  # For Ubuntu (and derivatives):
    sudo apt install acpi-call-dkms
  # For Arch Linux (and derivatives):
    sudo pacman -S linux-headers linux-lts-headers acpi_call-dkms
  
# 5. Run modprobe:
  sudo modprobe acpi_call

# 6. Test the calls:
  # For Ubuntu (and derivatives):
    sudo /usr/share/doc/acpi-call-dkms/examples/turn_off_gpu.sh
  # For Arch Linux (and derivatives):
    sudo /usr/share/acpi_call/examples/turn_off_gpu.sh

# 7. Register the one that worked. Look for the ending "works" and copy the code.
  # For example, my laptop uses \_SB.PCI0.PEG0.PEGP._OFF:
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.P0P1.VGA._OFF: failed
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.P0P2.VGA._OFF: failed
    Trying \_SB_.PCI0.OVGA.ATPX: failed
    Trying \_SB_.PCI0.OVGA.XTPX: failed
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.P0P3.PEGP._OFF: failed
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.P0P2.PEGP._OFF: failed
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.P0P1.PEGP._OFF: failed
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.MXR0.MXM0._OFF: failed
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.PEG1.GFX0._OFF: failed
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.PEG0.GFX0.DOFF: failed
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.PEG1.GFX0.DOFF: failed
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.PEG0.PEGP._OFF: works!
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.XVR0.Z01I.DGOF: failed
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.PEGR.GFX0._OFF: failed
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.PEG.VID._OFF: failed

    Trying \_SB.PCI0.IXVE.IGPU.DGOF: failed
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.RP00.VGA._PS3: failed
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.RP00.VGA.P3MO: failed
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.GFX0.DSM._T_0: failed
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.LPC.EC.PUBS._OFF: failed
    Trying \_SB.PCI0.P0P2.NVID._OFF: failed

# 8. Add the Nouveau open source driver to the blacklist:
  # I'm using Gedit, but you can choose a text editor of your choice (like Nano):
    sudo gedit /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
      # Add the line:
       blacklist nouveau
    
# 9. Load the ACPI call:
  sudo gedit /etc/modules
    # Add the line:
      acpi_call
      
# 10. Disable the dedicated video card:
  sudo gedit /etc/tmpfiles.d/acpi_call.conf
    # Add the line (replace the code with what you found):
      w /proc/acpi/call - - - - \\_SB.PCI0.PEG0.PEGP._OFF
      
# 11. Rebuild initrams:
  # For Ubuntu (and derivatives):
    sudo update-initramfs -u -k all
  # For Arch Linux (and derivatives):
    sudo mkinitcpio -P
  
# 12. Reboot. If it works fine, great. If there's any stability problem, see instructions below.

# 13. Try to remove the connections:
  sudo echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/[PCI code here]/remove
    # For example:
      sudo echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:01\:00.0/remove
      sudo echo 1 > /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:01\:00.1/remove
      
# 14. Check if the Nvidia card is gone from the list (it should be gone):
  lspci | grep NVIDIA
  
# 15. Remove connections before boot:
  sudo gedit /etc/tmpfiles.d/remove_gpu_from_lspci.conf
    # Add the lines:
      w /sys/bus/pci/devices/[c√≥digo do PCI aqui]/remove - - - - 1
        # For example:
          w /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:01\:00.0/remove - - - - 1
          w /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:01\:00.1/remove - - - - 1
          
# 16. Rebuild initrams:
  # For Ubuntu (and derivatives):
    sudo update-initramfs -u -k all
  # For Arch Linux (and derivatives):
    sudo mkinitcpio -P
  
# 17. Reboot and check if the heat problem and the abusive battery consumption are gone.
